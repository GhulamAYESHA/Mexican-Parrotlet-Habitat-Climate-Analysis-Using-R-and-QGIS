**Mexican Parrotlet Habitat & Climate Correlation**

Introduction

This repository contains code and data for a study investigating the relationship between environmental elements in Mexico and the occurrence of Mexican Parrotlets. The project aims to understand the distribution and habitat preferences of these parrotlets by analyzing geographic information and climate variables. The methodologies include data collection, preprocessing, and analysis, with a focus on exploring the correlation between parrotlet occurrence and climate factors such as average temperature and precipitation. The study utilizes exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to better comprehend the data and identify patterns and trends, with potential implications for population control and conservation efforts.

Methods

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Obtaining Mexico shapefile and Parrotlet occurrence data.

Data Extraction and Analysis: Filtering presence points and extracting world climate data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R: Correlation analysis and visualization of climate variables.

Leaflet Map Visualization: Creation of interactive maps to visualize parrotlet presence.

Results

Summary statistics, correlation analysis, and visualizations were generated to understand the relationship between Mexican Parrotlet presence and climate variables. The findings provide valuable insights into habitat preferences and potential conservation strategies.

Conclusion

This study successfully examined the connection between Mexican Parrotlet presence and local environmental conditions. The dataset's properties, including summary statistics and correlation coefficients, were revealed through exploratory data analysis. Visualizations such as scatter plots and leaflet maps provided spatial representations of the data, enhancing our understanding of the relationships. Overall, this study offers crucial knowledge to researchers and conservationists working to protect and manage the Mexican Parrotlet population.
